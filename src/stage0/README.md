# Stage 0

This stage is meant to demonstrate speeds for no optimizations. The database will contain all the data that it was given. Since data is not grouped and there are no calculations done when it inserts, the data will be very slow to display on the frontend.

This stage is meant to be a baseline and serves as an example of what should not be done when trying to do complex calculations on large amounts of data.
